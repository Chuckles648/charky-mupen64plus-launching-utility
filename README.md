# charky-mupen64plus-launching-utility
A simple winform program serving as a GUI for mupen64plus. 

Current features are only support for mupen's parameters through the command line
Future plans include more GUIs to tweak mupen's settings to reduce the amount of text editing

You MAY NOT modify, edit, or reupload this program without explicit permission.

-------- INSTALL -------
YOU NEED TO HAVE .NET RUNTIME 8.0.13 FOR THIS PROGRAM TO WORK

x64 Architecture

x86 Architecture
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-8.0.13-windows-x86-installer

After that simply extract the executable, data folder, and dll to where mupen64plus-ui-console.exe is located

------- USAGE -------
There are no special use instructions, just run the executable.

Once open:
1. Click on "Change ROM Path" and select the folder where your ROMS for the N64 are.
   The middle portion will auto-populate and you can select a game to play through that list.
2. The bottom text box can be used to edit the parameters you want to pass through to mupen64plus.
   Hitting save allows you to keep those parameters for when you use the program in the future.
   The clear button allows you to clear the parameters from both the text box and the file they are stored in.
3. Hit Launch and play
   The program will stay running in the background and after you close the actual emulator,
   allowing you to select another game or edit parameters etc.

Enjoy
